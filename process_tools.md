### htop

Htop is an advanced process monitor, written for Linux. It was intended to replace the standard top program. Htop shows a dynamic list of system process, the list is typically justified on the CPU. Unlike top, htop shows all the processes in the system, also shows uptime, CPU usage and memory. Htop is often used in cases where the information given by the utility top is not enough, for example when searching for memory leaks in the process.
